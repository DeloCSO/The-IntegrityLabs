<analysis>**original_problem_statement**: 
The user's goal is to build a high-quality, professional landing page for The IntegrityLabs, a platform aimed at both students and founders. The initial request was for a simple two-card hero layout. However, the project evolved through multiple iterations, including significant content and branding updates, a major architectural refactor from a modal-based navigation system to a route-based one, the implementation of Supabase email/password authentication, and several redesigns of the core visual infographics to align with a clarity-first, trust-sensitive editorial style.

PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:
- A multi-page website with routes for a landing page (), a student-focused section (), and a founder-focused event section ().
- A dark theme with a specific black and cyan color palette.
- A minimal Supabase email/password authentication system as a credibility layer, not for gating content.
- A consistent, two-column layout for the  and  pages, with text content on the left and minimalist, text-driven infographics on the right.
- All copy and visuals must be serious, calm, and intentional, avoiding any SaaS-like or hype aesthetics.
- The primary CTA on the hero page should lead to a decision point for the user to navigate to either  or .

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The project is a full-stack application with a React frontend and a minimal FastAPI backend. The frontend is fully functional and styled according to the user's detailed specifications. It features a route-based architecture with three pages: , , and . Supabase email/password authentication is integrated, with the login/logout state managed globally via React Context. The  and  pages share a unified two-column layout with editorial-style infographics. All content is statically served from a  file.

**Last working item**: 
- **Last item agent was working**: The agent was performing a final redesign of the  page's infographic. This involved replacing the previous visual with a purely text-driven, multi-step flow that explains How Clarity Actually Forms, using only typography, spacing, and subtle separators to align with the user's strict editorial design constraints.
- **Status**: USER VERIFICATION PENDING
- **Agent Testing Done**: Y
- **Which testing method agent to use?**: screenshot tool
- **User Testing Done**: Y

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
- None. The last user request was fulfilled and committed after approval.

**In progress Task List**:
- None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **Task 1: Implement Application Form Backend (P1)**
  - **Where to resume**: The  component currently does not submit data anywhere. The user had initially requested this modal. While recent changes redirected the main CTAs to Google Forms, the modal itself was never connected. If it's to be used in the future, it will need a backend implementation (e.g., sending an email or saving to a database).
  - **What will be achieved with this?**: A functional application submission flow.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Architecture Refactor**: Successfully migrated the entire site from a complex, modal-based navigation system to a clean, route-based architecture using React Router (, , ).
- **Supabase Authentication**: Implemented a full email/password authentication system, replacing an earlier magic-link implementation. This includes sign-up, login, and logout functionalities managed via a global .
- **UI/UX Unification**: Refactored the  and  pages to use a consistent two-column layout, ensuring visual harmony between the two main sections.
- **Editorial Visual Redesign**: Executed multiple iterations on the infographics for both  and , evolving them from generic SaaS-like cards to minimalist, text-first diagrams that support the content without being decorative.
- **Content and CTA Refinement**: Performed numerous copy updates across the entire site to align with the brand's clarity-first and trust-sensitive tone.
- **Concept Removal**: Systematically removed the Forge concept from all navigation, routes, and user-facing components as requested.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
- **Issue 1: Linting Errors in Shadcn UI Components**
  - **Debug checklist**: The agent identified linting errors (e.g., unescaped entities, unknown properties) within the pre-packaged  directory.
  - **Why to solve this issue and what will be achieved with this?**: Fixing these would result in a clean linting report and improve overall code hygiene. However, it was considered out-of-scope as it pertains to third-party library code.
  - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix**: Frontend
  - **Is recurring issue?**: Y

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
- None

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Frontend**: React, React Router, Tailwind CSS
- **Authentication**: Supabase (Email/Password)
- **State Management**: React Context API ()
- **UI**: Shadcn/UI components, custom-built components
- **Backend**: FastAPI (minimal usage)
- **Database**: MongoDB (configured but not in active use for application features)

**key DB schema**
- **Supabase**:  (managed by Supabase)
- **MongoDB**:  (from initial boilerplate, not core to the app)

**changes in tech stack**
-  was installed and integrated for authentication.

**All files of reference**
- : Contains the layout and content for the student community section.
- : Contains the layout and content for the founder event section.
- : The final, editorial-style infographic for the Baseline page.
- : The final, editorial-style infographic for the Makerspace page.
- : Manages global authentication state.
- : The single modal for both sign-up and login.
- : Defines the application's routes.
- : Central file for all static copy on the website.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- **Obsolete **: The  component was created based on a user request, but subsequent changes redirected the primary CTAs on both the  and  pages to external Google Forms. This has likely rendered  and its associated state management in  obsolete. This code should be reviewed and potentially removed to clean up the codebase.

**key api endpoints**
- All primary functionality is handled client-side. The app interacts with Supabase for authentication but does not use the project's own FastAPI backend for any core features.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **Strict User Approval Workflow**: The user requires a strict workflow: implement changes, generate preview screenshots, and **STOP** to ask for explicit approval before committing. Do not commit any changes without the user's direct confirmation.
- **Design Philosophy**: The user has a very strong and specific design philosophy. Avoid any UI/UX that feels like a generic SaaS product, course platform, or marketing page. The desired aesthetic is editorial, calm, serious, and trust-sensitive. Content must always visually dominate over design elements.
- **Current Architecture**: The site uses a route-based page structure. Do not revert to modal-based navigation for primary content sections.
- **Unified Layout**: The  and  pages must maintain their unified two-column layout (content left, infographic right) for consistency.
- **Supabase Credentials**: The required Supabase URL and anon key are stored in .

**documents and test reports created in this job**
- None.

**Project Health Check:**
- **Broken**: The application is stable. Earlier issues with browser crashes during screenshotting were intermittent and worked around.
- **Mocked**: The entire frontend is powered by static content from . No application data is being fetched from the backend database.

**3rd Party Integrations**
- **Supabase**: Integrated for email and password authentication. This requires user-provided API keys set in the environment.

**Testing status**
- Testing agent used after significant changes: NO (Agent primarily used the screenshot tool for visual verification).
- Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop: NO
- Test files created: None
- Known regressions: None

**Credentials to test flow:**
- To test the authentication flow, use the Login button in the header and create a new account via the Sign up toggle in the .

**What agent forgot to execute**
- The agent did not clean up the  component and its related state management after the user's requirements changed, redirecting the main application CTAs to external Google Forms. This component is likely now unused and should be considered for removal.</analysis>
